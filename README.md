# Projects and Activities
This repository is linked to my CV and lists most of the projects and activities I participated to. 

## Projects

- **Prefoundation startup experience:** Co-developed early-stage concepts and pilot projects at [**PickEat**](https://tech.pickeat.it/), strengthening skills in co-design of front-end and back-end apps using Dart, Flutter, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.

- [**Flexible Automation Project**](https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/flexible_automation_simulation) 🛠️: Used Lua in CoppeliaSim to simulate a working cell in a manufacturing process.

- **Research Track [I.1](https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/first_assignment), [I.2](https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/second_assignment), and [II](https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/rt2_assignment1) Projects** 📚: Assignments for *Research Track I* and *II*, involving implementation of core ROS functionality, navigation algorithms, and manipulation tasks. Tools used: Python, C++, and Robot Operating System (ROS).

- [**C++ Programming Techniques Project**](https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/C-ProgTechProj) 💻: Coursework for the *C++ Programming Techniques* Ph.D. program course.

- [**Parking Advisor**](https://github.com/measurify/example-parking-management) 🚗: Assignment for the *Multimedia Apps and the Internet of the Future* and *Maker’s Approach to Electronic Design* courses. A mobile app developed in Java with Android Studio to help users avoid parking fines.

- [**Embedded Systems Project**](https://github.com/AlessioRoda/embedded_assignment) 🧠: Project for the *Embedded Systems* course, involving microprocessor control implementation in C++.

- [**Cooperative Robotics – Submarine Navigation**](https://github.com/AlessioRoda/cooperative) 🌊: Implemented inverse kinematics for cooperative underwater robots using Task Priority paradigm in MATLAB.

- [**Artificial Intelligence for Robotics Project**](https://github.com/ermannoGirardo/AI_Second_Assignment) 🤖: Project for the *Artificial Intelligence for Robotics* course, implementing planning for a robot waiter using PDDL and C++.

- [**Software Architectures for Robotics Project**](https://github.com/AlessioRoda/mobile_robot_navigation_project) 🗺️: Project for the *Software Architectures for Robotics* course, involving the implementation of mobile robot navigation. Tools used: Python, C++, and ROS.

- [**Experimental Robotics Lab – Cluedo Game Simulation**](https://github.com/EnzoUbaldoPetrocco/ExperimentalRoboticsLab) 🎲: Designed a multi-agent simulation inspired by the Cluedo game, integrating symbolic reasoning and task planning. Implemented planning logic in PDDL and orchestrated robotic behaviors using ROS (Python and C++).

## Didactic Support
- **Reti Logiche** (Logic Nets) didactic support. This role included correcting assignments of the students. First semester of 2023 and 2024 years.
- **Progetto Matricole** (freshmen project). This role included helping freshmen covering basics of mathematics for engineering courses. Academic year 2023/2024.

## Events, certificates, and others:

- In 2023 and 2024, attended and presented my work at the **I-RIM** Conference in Rome (October).

- In 2023 and 2024, participant in the **Genova Science Festival** (October).

- In 2023 and 2024, participant and exhibitor at **Maker Faire** Rome (October).

- In 2024, presented research at **RoboValley**, Genoa (April).

- In 2020, obtained the Cambridge English B2 **First** (FCE) Certificate.
